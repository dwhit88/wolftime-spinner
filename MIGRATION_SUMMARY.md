# Migration Summary: CSV to Google Sheets

## What Changed

Your Wolftime Spinner app has been successfully upgraded from CSV file storage to Google Sheets API integration. Here's what was modified:

### Backend Changes (`server.js`)

- ✅ Removed CSV file dependencies (`csv-parser`, `csv-writer`)
- ✅ Added Google Sheets API integration
- ✅ Updated all API endpoints to use Google Sheets instead of CSV
- ✅ Maintained the same API structure - no frontend changes needed
- ✅ Added proper error handling for Google Sheets operations

### New Files Created

- `googleSheetsService.js` - Core service for Google Sheets operations
- `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide
- `env.example` - Environment variables template
- `test-google-sheets.js` - Test script to verify integration
- `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Dependencies Updated

- ✅ Added `googleapis` package for Google Sheets API
- ✅ Removed `csv-parser` and `csv-writer` packages
- ✅ Added `test:sheets` script to package.json

### Frontend (`script.js`)

- ✅ **No changes required** - all existing functionality works the same
- ✅ Same API endpoints, same data structure
- ✅ Same user interface and experience

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Set Up Google Sheets API (Required)

Follow the detailed instructions in `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md`:

1. Create a Google Cloud Project
2. Enable Google Sheets API
3. Create a service account
4. Set up a Google Spreadsheet
5. Configure environment variables

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with your Google Sheets credentials:

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp env.example .env

# Edit with your actual values
nano .env
```

Required variables:

- `GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID` - Your spreadsheet ID
- `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` - Your service account JSON key

### 3. Test the Integration

Before starting your server, test the Google Sheets connection:

```bash
npm run test:sheets
```

This will verify your setup is working correctly.

### 4. Start Your Server

Once the test passes, start your server as usual:

```bash
npm start
```

## Benefits of the Migration

### ✅ **Data Persistence**

- Your data now survives server restarts
- No more lost updates when the server goes down
- Data is stored in Google's reliable cloud infrastructure

### ✅ **Real-time Updates**

- All changes are immediately saved to Google Sheets
- Multiple users can view/edit simultaneously
- Automatic version history and backup

### ✅ **Easy Management**

- View and edit data directly in Google Sheets
- Share access with team members
- Export data in various formats

### ✅ **No Breaking Changes**

- Same user interface and experience
- Same API endpoints
- Same data structure and functionality

## What Stays the Same

- ✅ All frontend functionality
- ✅ All API endpoints (`/api/scoreboard`, `/api/scoreboard/update`, etc.)
- ✅ Same data structure (Id, Name, isDev, questionsAsked, etc.)
- ✅ Same authentication system
- ✅ Same Docker setup and deployment
- ✅ Same user experience and interface

## Rollback Plan

If you need to temporarily revert to CSV storage:

1. Stop the server
2. Comment out the Google Sheets service import in `server.js`
3. Uncomment the CSV-related code
4. Reinstall CSV dependencies: `npm install csv-parser csv-writer`
5. Restart the server

However, this is not recommended as you'll lose the benefits of persistent data storage.

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check the test script**: `npm run test:sheets`
2. **Review the setup guide**: `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md`
3. **Check server logs** for detailed error messages
4. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
5. **Ensure Google Sheets API** is enabled in your project

## Next Steps

1. **Complete the Google Sheets setup** following `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md`
2. **Test the integration** with `npm run test:sheets`
3. **Start your server** and verify everything works
4. **Enjoy persistent data storage** that survives server downtime!

**Note**: Your existing CSV data will be preserved once you copy it into the Google Spreadsheet. The migration is designed to be seamless with no data loss.
